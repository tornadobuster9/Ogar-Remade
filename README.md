# Ogar-Remade
A modified version of Ogar

Please note that I DID NOT create this. You can find the original
project over here at https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar

If you want a list of commands then type "help" into the console.

To start the server just double click the "StartMac.command" if
you're on a mac or "StartWindows.bat" if you're on windows. Right
now there is not start script for linux.

If you find a bug, let me know in the issues section.
